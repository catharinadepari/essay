## Digital Geography for Natural Heritage Conservation Mobilization in the U.S.<br>

### :newspaper: Introduction
### A. Digital Geography<br>
Digital technology has long enabled scholars to explain phenomena related to almost all aspects of urban living: politics, social, culture, economy, and nature. The relationship between the digital technology and geography takes at least 3 forms:
- **produced through**, meaning that the digital technology is aimed at actualizing unorthodox understanding to produce geographic, politics, and spatial knowledges. Despite criticsm against its use, the engagement between the digital technology and geography has proven to be able to mobilize people power for social change;
- **produced by**, meaning that digital system served cities planning, management, governance, and research by integrating the urban big data, computational modelling, urban simulation, and interactions with diffent users and urban spaces;
- **geographies of digital**, meaning that the digital geographies are sets of technologies that go beyond an engagement with an interface, but with spatial big data. One of the examples is the  geotagged data retrieved from Twitter that can be used to explain sociospatial dynamics in particular area to public (James, Kitchin and Leszczynski 2018, 26-34).<br>

> With this understanding, the web map entitled **`America's Public Land Giveaway`** written by *Andre Miller* is selected for this essay. The web map provides a good example of how the author carefully designed and selected interactive elements that is integrated to a ctorymap style. It convinces public in a persuasive way about the implications of the U.S. government's unreformed land leasing system in the Western part of this country and hope of mobilizing civic power for the land leasing system reformation and natural heritage conservation.<br>

### B. Case Study<br>
The **`goal`** of the web map is *to discuss the implications of the U.S. government's policy of leasing millions of acres of public lands for private oil and gas development with low and outdated rent price and its impacts on the natural heritage conservation efforts in the Western part of the U.S*. These natural heritage include **Dinosaur National Monument** and critical habitats of plant and animal species situated in 10 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming. The issues revolve around:
- un-updated leasing system for oil and gas industries' operations in the West and private companies' actions of taking advantages from this.
- inproportionate composition between oil and gas industries uses and public uses in land use where 90% of the land is dedicated for the industries and only 10% is for recreational and conservation purposes.
- the Trump administration of offering 24.5 million acres nationwide for these industries, hence,more than 13.5 millions acres for public uses. <br>

It should be noted that these private companies **pay for the lands below the market price** and leave much of idle leased acres off limits to other uses. <br>

<img src="img/dinos_abuse.png" width='900'> <br>

Surprisingly, despite the leasing system has not been renewed by Congress, it has already locked up millions of acres of public land in these states. The disadvantages resulted from this are ineffective use of the lands. Based on their studies, many oil and gas industries produced only limited amount of these energy resources.<br>

The **`major functions`** of the web map is to **express geographic dimension of human experience in natural heritage conservation in the Western part of the U.S**. In long turn, the web map has potential to mobilize public to encourage the congress to modernize the oil and gas leasing system in these areas. Thus, the ineffective leased lands could be utilized for more proper functions: improving the life quality of societies and the protected animals and plants in the natural heritage sites. <br>

The web map does not limit its audience to particular groups, rather to the public audience. It is expected that the story could develop public awareness on the issue and mobilize them to encourage Congress and the U.S. government to revise the land leasing system and land utilization in the West.<br>

The web map serves as an interactive display of geographic information that not only tells social story but also answers users' questions regarding data related to this issue. This web map is designed by considering **interactive display** and allows people to reflect how the invisible **`panopticon`** <href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham"> along with its machine exercises power in the U.S.(Foucault 2014, 660).<br>

The developers of the web map are a non-profit organization for wildlife conservation, **`ï»¿The Wilderness Society`** <https://www.wilderness.org/about-us> and a nonpartisan conservation and advocacy organization for the American West, **`Center for Western Priorities`** <https://westernpriorities.org/about/>.<br>

### :bar_chart: Systematic Architecture
In order to create, serve, and use web mapping, several different machines are required. The machines are often depicted in a diagram consisting of separate levels, or tiers of architecture. The figure below shows the **`Web Client Application`** which extends into **`External Internet`** and then, systematically continues to **`Internal Network`**, **`Web-server`** and **`Geospatial server`**. The line then branches to 2 systems: **`File Server`** and **`Database server`**. In the left part of the diagram is another computer drawing called as **`Administrators`** and **`Internal Client Application`**.<br>

<img src="img/system_arc.png" width='900'> <br>

The systematic architecture of the web map is explained as follows:
- *desktop workstations* are used by the web's administrators and internal client applications to prepare data, author maps, including administer the other machines.
- *database server* and *file server* act as what hold the GIS data and research data of the two organizations. The data might consist of spatial data in raster or vector formats.
- *geospatial server* used to host the web services in this project is that provided by ArcGIS <https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/geoportal-server/overview>. Esri Geoportal Server is known as an open source product that since 1969 has contrbuted in enabling many organizations like the two nonprofit conservation organizations to manage and publish their geospatial data and resources for wide range of users.<br>

<img src="img/arcgis.png" width='900'><br>

As can be seen from the footnote of the web map, it was powered by **`ArcGIS`** provided by ESRI geoportal server.

### :lock_with_ink_pen: Code Analysis
<br>
To investigate the codes employed by the web map, I inspected the web map by right-clicking the web browser. In this part, I will discuss some important elements and codes of the web, the data that flow between client and server, web's major libraries and codes that specifically evidence its responsiveness.<br>

*First*, to enable client to track any applications that supports JavaScript, the code the developers used is: <br>

```
var _paq = _paq || [];
  /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
  _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
  _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
  _paq.push(['trackAllContentImpressions']);
  (function() {
    var u="https://storymaps-analytics.arcgis.com/";
    _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'analytics.php']);
    _paq.push(['setSiteId', '7']);
    var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    g.type='text/javascript'; g.async=true; g.defer=true; g.src=u+'analytics.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
  })();
```
<br>

*Second*, the code for scaling the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) which means it will allow us to set the coordinates as well as width and height
<br>
```
<svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="jsx-2552718285">
<path d="M16.707 16l10.607 10.606-.708.707L16 16.707 5.394 27.313l-.708-.707L15.293 16 4.686 5.394l.708-.707L16 15.293 26.606 4.687l.708.707z" class="jsx-2552718285">
</path>
</svg>
```
<br>

*Third*, the code for matching the web map to other widget or small gadgets:
<br>
```
div class="esri-widget--button esri-widget esri-interactive"
```
<br>

*Fourth*, the code for establishing a new coordinate system inside the element where the transformations apply to so the units specified for the element and its children will be scaled according to the transformation :
<br>
```
g transform='matrix()'
```
<br>

*Fifth*, code for displaying a piece of content, generally images with an optional caption:
<br>
```
figure class =
```
<br>
#### Data Flows Between Client and Server
The data used by the wed developer come from the two nonprofit organizations' own studies and other resources which are linked to the web. These data include:<br>

- the *Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987 100th Congress (1987-1988)* <https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/2851> to support the author's argument that the leasing system on land for oil and gas drilling was very outdated.<br>

- the *spatial distribution of federal oil and gas leases* comprising of those leased for minimum bid ($2 per acre), those leased noncompetitively (below $2 per acre), and leased under Trump administration<br>

<img src="img/data3a.png" width='900'><br>

- the *spatial distribution of natural heritae sites*: national parks, monuments, conservation areas, wilderness areas, prioritized sage-grouse habitat, and mule deer migration corridor<br>

<img src="img/data4.png" width='900'><br>

- the *spatial conflict* between the industries' exploration sites and the mule deer migration corridor<br>

<img src="img/data5.png" width='900'><br>

#### Libraries
Libraries in web-based javascript is used to provide various functions, whether the matter is related to events or effects or AJAX, and allows map developers to perform a task. The major libraries used by this web map developer along with their functions is **`analytics.js`** library with script tag:

<br>
```
script type="text/javascript" async="" defer="" src="https://storymaps-analytics.arcgis.com/analytics.js"
```

<br>
The **analytics.js** library has the same function as **Google Analytics** and is classified as a JavaScript library. The tag's function is measure how often users interact with the web map.
<br>

A good interactive web map should be responsive to different users and settings. **Responsive design** is defined as a set of strategies for using the Open Web Platform that dynamically change the content, layout, and styling of a webpage based on the display device and user context. Inspecting the web's codes, the examined project is a responsive web map design particularly because it uses the following elements:<br>

**`META TAGS`**
<br>
The meta tag tells the browser what width it should render the viewport at (*adaptive cartography*)
<br>

```
meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"
```
<br>

<img src="img/app2.png" width='900'>
<br>

With meta tag, the web map designs will change/adapt based on different use and user contexts, and the computing system could be held in hand, such as a smartphone or tablet (*mobile device*) with code:
<br>

```
meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"
```
<br>

<img src="img/app5.png" width='900'>
<br>

**`DIV TAGS`**
<br>
The div tag interlocks set of horizontal rows and vertical columns in a webpage responsively with size based on relative percentage (*fluid grid*) with code:
<br>

```
div class="page-container"
```
<br>

<img src="img/app3.png" width='900'>
<br>
The div tag adds a full width containers (which spans 100% of window) inside a container which has a fixed width and aligned center. The code used by the web map is:
<br>

```
div class="container full-screen main"
```
<br>

<img src="img/app4.png" width='900'>
<br>

### :books: Data Sources
#### A. Data Types
<br>
There are two major types of data used by the web developer: vector and raster. In terms of **vector**, the polygons in the maps indicate the different size of land parcel with different land leases. <br>

| Data type  |Format      | Descriptions |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| *geojson*  | vector | polygons of land lots/parcels to show 3 types of land leases |
| *tilelayer* | raster | land contours in the U.S. states|

For instance, the screenshot below shows three types of land leases throughout the U.S. states: federal oil and gas leases (yellow), those leased with minimum bid (blue), and leased noncompetitively (red)<br>.

Investigating the web's codes, we will find the GeoJson type of file is utilized to develop the maps. The codes associated with the GeoJson files were written in the lines of 745 and 1676.
<br>
<img src="img/vector1.png" width='800'>
<br>
In the meantime, the **raster** type data is presented through tilelayer which shows the different elevation of land contours in their areas of study. Here, one of the codes associated to the raster map that is written in the line of 880.
<br>
<img src="img/raster1.png" width='800'>
<br>

#### B. Critiques on the UI/UX
<br>
The **UI (User Interface)** and **UX (User Experience)** Design are two crucial components of a web map which work closely together. Despite their similar roles, each component has different design and process. The User Experience (UX) considers **`each element`** that can effectively influence users' experience and perceptions, and easiness to access the web map. The UI design  focuses on the appearance, presentation, and interactivity of the web map with user. <br>
In my opinion, this web map's developers have **integrated storymap with digital geography** and thoughfully considered the interaction between users and their web map. The UI and UX designs of this web map are explained as follows:<br>

- users can expand the thematic map by clicking the icon at the top-right and clicking the legend at the left-bottom. This makes users easily read, observe, and interact with the map. Clicking the expland icon again will bring the user back to former page with brief narrative.<br>
<img src="img/in2.png" width='900'>
<br>
- users captures the developers' emphasis via animated zoom on the page of National Dinosaur Monument
<br>
<img src="img/in3.png" width='900'>
<br>
- users can zoom in and zoom out the map with accordance to their needs
<br>
<img src="img/in4.png" width='900'>
<br>
- users can choose each item of the page/data list to revisit each page of the web
<br>
<img src="img/in5.png" width='900'>
<br>
- users can obtain details of data of each state by clicking specific area of the map.
<br>
<img src="img/data6_interact.png" width='900'>
<br>
- users can highlight an area on map and obtain detailed data features. Users can also zoom in or go to next data using elements in that data box.
<br>
<img src="img/data7_interact2.png" width='900'>
<br>

### :page_with_curl: Descriptions of Web Map Elements
<br>
The basemap used in the webmap is attributed to those in **`Esri Gallery`** with the following script tag:
<br>
```
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="https://js.arcgis.com/4.15/esri/layers/TileLayer.js">
```
<br>
There are five thematic maps used in this web map :
- Theme 1. types of federal and oil gas leases map (minimum bids, noncompetitively bids, under Trump administration)
- Theme 2. dinosaur national monument map
- Theme 3. priority sage-grouse habitat map
- Theme 4. red-desert to hoback migration map in Southern Wyoming/mule deer migration corridor
- Theme 5. federal oil and gas leases still available to buy noncompetitively.
<br>

Each thematic map is produced from the layer that uses the researchers' GeoJson data files or the overlays between several layers that use different GeoJson data files. Each layer is then outlaid with the ESRI basemap.
<br>
The web map developers used tilelayers from Esri. As can be seen from the screenshot below, the web developed uses a scrip tag refering to **`esri`** layers with scrip tag:
<br>

```
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="https://js.arcgis.com/4.15/esri/layers/TileLayer.js"
```
<br>

<img src="img/tiles.png" width='900'>
<br>

The interactive elements used by the web map developers include:
**`Interactive Map View`**
- the controlable zoom-in and zoom-out
- the GeoJson event where a layer will appear on certain pages, overlaying the visited page/map. For instance, when we scroll down the Dinosaur National Monument page, the federal oil and gas leased lands will appear and overlay the existing map of the Dinosaur National Monument map.
- the map will be enlarged as user click the expand icon on the top-right of the page/map <br>
**`Interactive Legend`**
- the legend will appear as user click the legend icon on the bottom-left of the page/map

<br>
Besides the interactive elements, the other element is the home icon that allows user to return to the first page. The web developer does not use scale and compas which indicate the weaknesses of this web map. <br>

### :bulb: Strengths & Weaknesses
#### Strengths
The strengths of the web map are:
- it provides an example a responsive designed web map as it is adaptive to different users, interactive as it allows users to expand the map and legend, and mobile device friendly.
- it has interactive elements that are relatively easy to navigate and help users to explore the map, and more importantly, to obtain some details about the data used for the spatial maps. Users can also explore the page without being overwhelmed with too many options.
- it gives a suprise effect as users navigate the *Dinosaur National Monument* page where the map is automatically zooms-in. The developers bring users to the focus on the issue by zooming in the federal oil and gas leased lands that are conflicted with the heritage site.
<br>

#### Weaknesses
The weaknesses of the web map are:<br>
- since each layer contains numerous amount of data featurs of 10 states, some maps in page of **mule migration corridor** for instance, has a very slow processing to be completely uploaded. This consequently requires users to have a strong network connection and high-hardware specifications with better graphic card (Roth et al. 2018)

<img src="img/proc.png" width='900'>
<br>
- some data are better displayed with **`real time visualization`** so it can convey the change of the spatial structure of the leased land from 1897 to the current time. The real-time data visualization has widely been used to perform real-time monitoring of critical city infrastructure and to increase transparency (Goodchild (2010) and Hudson-Smith,Batty (2014) mentioned in Li, et al., 2019, pp. 3-10).

### :thought_balloon: Discussion
<br>
The web map represents an effective use of digital geography in producing a spatial knowledge in an emotional and reflexive ways (James, et al., 2018, p. 28). **Emotional** means it develops concerns and sympathy of the users participate in solving the issue. **Reflexive** means that it encourages users to reflect the conflict and mobilize to change the undesired condition.<br> Despite the effectiveness of social media in mobilizing people is highly dependent upon a lot of factors (e.g., political system of the country, government's control, literacies, internet access) (Kay, et al., 2020, p. 355), the **data crawling technique** from social media such as Twitter might be useful to inform users about public perceptions on this spatial conflict. <br>

Using a form of a story map, the web map effectively communicates its goal. The 3 narrative elements of this web map include:
<br>
**`Set-up Act `**
<br>
The **settings** are the leased lands for oil and gas drilling in ten states in the U.S.: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming. The **key characters** are the Trump administrators, Congress who still unreformed the leasing system policy, and the conservationists who defend the public rights over the needs of recreations and conservations. The **problem** is  the conflict between the U.S. government and conservationists, between the land commercialization/industrialization and natural heritage conservation. The **time** is framed within the Trump's administrative.
<br>
**`Conflict Act`**
<br>
The**key issue** of the story is the conflict between the U.S. government and conservationists who are compelled to protect the natural heritage conservation in the ten states in the face of unrealistic land leasing system of the U.S. Unlike a common narrative or drama, this researh-based story map is built gradually from introducing the conflict to the recommendation for future spatial planniang and policy making.
<br>
**`Resolution Act`**
<br>
The **recommendations/solutions** are assessing the land's suitability for oil and gas leasing through comprehensive planning processes, engaging community in the planning, raising the national minimum bid from $2.00 per acre to at least $10.00 per acre, and setting up a reliable evaluation to evaluate the lessees' capacity of exploring and producing oil and gas
<br>
