## Digital Geography for Natural Heritage Conservation Mobilization in the U.S.<br>

### :newspaper: Introduction
### A. Digital Geography<br>
Digital technology has long enabled scholars to explain phenomena related to almost all aspects of urban living: politics, social, culture, economy, and nature. The relationship between the digital technology and geography takes at least 3 forms:
- **produced through**, meaning that the digital technology is aimed at actualizing unorthodox understanding to produce geographic, politics, and spatial knowledges. Despite criticsm against its use, the engagement between the digital technology and geography has proven to be able to mobilize people power for social change;
- **produced by**, meaning that digital system served cities planning, management, governance, and research by integrating the urban big data, computational modelling, urban simulation, and interactions with diffent users and urban spaces;
- **geographies of digital**, meaning that the digital geographies are sets of technologies that go beyond an engagement with an interface, but with spatial big data. One of the examples is the  geotagged data retrieved from Twitter that can be used to explain sociospatial dynamics in particular area to public (James, Kitchin and Leszczynski 2018, 26-34). <br>

With this understanding, the storymap entitled **`America's Public Land Giveaway`** written by *Andre Miller* is selected for this essay. The storymap provides a good example of how the author carefully designed and selected the web features to provide public with understanding on the implications of government's unreformed land leasing system and regulation in the Western part of the U.S. and to mobilize supports from the U.S. public for land conservation.<br>

### B. Case Study<br>
The goal of the storymap is *to discuss the implications of the federal government and Trump administration's policy of leasing millions of acres of public lands for private oil and gas development with low and outdated rent price on conservation sites of natural heritage in the Western part of the U.S*. These natural heritage include Dinosaur National Monument and critical habitats of plant and animal species situated in 10 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming. The issue revolves around the un-updated leasing system for oil and gas industries' operations in the West. The leasing system had not been renewed since a century ago. However, the leasing has already locked up millions of acres of public land in the West. The disadvantages resulted from this are the ineffective use of the land since limited amount of oil and gas produced from the current oil and gas industries, the decrease in annual tax return at only $ 1.50 per acre for taxpayers, and risks on the natural heritage conservation. <br>
**The major functions of the storymap** is to mobilize public supports for encouraging the congress to modernize the oil and gas leasing system. Through this, the land could be utilized for social, cultural, and environmental purposes which include public recreation and natural heritage conservation. <br> For this reason, the story map does not limit its audience to particular group, rather to the public audience. It is expected that the story could develop public awareness on the issue and mobilize them to encourage congress and the U.S. government to revise the land leasing system and land utilization in the West.<br> The storymap is the evidence of the power of digital geography which enables people to recognize the urban issue and observe how the unseen **`panopticon`** <href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham"> along with its machine exercised power in the U.S.(Foucault 2014, 660).<br>
The authors of the storymap are a non-profit organization for wildlife conservation, **`ï»¿The Wilderness Society`** <https://www.wilderness.org/about-us> and a nonpartisan conservation and advocacy organization for the American West, **`Center for Western Priorities`** <https://westernpriorities.org/about/>.<br>

### :bar_chart: Systematic Architecture
In order to create, serve, and use web mapping, several different machines are required. The machines are often depicted in a diagram consisting of separate levels, or tiers of architecture. The figure below shows the **Web Client Application** label which extends into a little cloud labeled as **External Internet**. The line from this cloud continues to **Internal Network** label which then leads to **Web-server** and **Geospatial server**  below it. The line then branches to **File Server** and **Database server**. In the left, there is another computer drawing labeled as **Administrators** and **Internal Client Application**.<br>

<img src="img/system_arc.png" align='center' width='800'> <br>

The systematic architecture of the web map is explained as follows:
- **desktop workstations** are used by the web's administrators and internal client applications to prepare data, author maps, including administer the other machines.
- **database server** and **file server** act as what hold the GIS data and research data of the two organizations. The data might consist of spatial data in raster or vector formats.
- **geospatial server** used to host the web services in this project is that provided by ArcGIS <https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/geoportal-server/overview>. Esri Geoportal Server is known as an open source product that since 1969, has enabled many organizations like the two nonprofit conservation organizations to manage and publish their geospatial data and resources for wide range of users. <br>

<img src="img/arcgis.png" align='center' width='800'> <br>

As can be seen from the footnote of the storymap in the above image, the web map was powered by the use of **`ArcGIS`** provided by ESRI geoportal server.

### :lock_with_ink_pen: Code Analysis
In order to investigate the codes employed by the web map, we inspected the web by right-clicking the web browser. As seen from the image below, we found the elements and codes of the web, the data flowed between the client and server, the major libraries with their functions, and whether the web supports responsive design.<br>
<img src="img/inspection.png" align='center' width='500'><br>
-  **`var _paq = _paq || []`** to help client to track any application that supports JavaScript like websites
-  **`svg viewBox="" class="" `** to scale the SVG element that we can set the coordinates as well as width and height
-  **`div class="esri-widget--button esri-widget esri-interactive" `** to match to other widget or small gadgets.
-  **`g transform='matrix()' `** to establish a new coordinate system inside the element where the transformations apply to. This means that the units specified for the element and its children might not follow the 1:1 pixel mapping, but are also distorted and scaled according to the transformation.
-  **`figure class ='' `** to display a piece of content, generally images with an optional caption.

### A. Data Flows Between Client and Server
The data flowed between the client and server come not only from the two nonprofit organizations' studies, but also information from other resources linked to the web. The data obtained from the web map include:
- the *Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987 100th Congress (1987-1988)* <https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/2851>. It is used to support the author's argument that the leasing system on land for oil and gas drilling was outdated. <br><img src="img/data1.png" align='center' width='500'><br>
-the spatial distribution of federal oil and gas leases comprising of those leased for minimum bid ($2 per acre), those leased noncompetitively (below $2 per acre), and leased under Trump administration<br><img src="img/data3.png" align='center' width='500'><br>
- the spatial distribution of national parks, monuments, conservation areas, and wilderness areas, including the prioritized sage-grouse habitat, and mule deer migration corridor<br><img src="img/data4.png" align='center' width='500'><br>
- the spatial conflict between the industries' exploration sites and the mule deer migration corridor<br><img src="img/data5.png" align='center' width='500'><br>

### B. Libraries
Libraries in web map based javascript is used to provide various functions, whether the matter is related to events or effects or AJAX. All these libraries allow map creators or developers to perform a task. The major libraries used by the web map along with their functions include:
- <script type="text/javascript" async="" defer="" src="https://storymaps-analytics.arcgis.com/analytics.js">. <br> The script refers to **`analytics.js`** library or **`Google Analytics`**, which is a JavaScript library aimed at measuring how users interact with the web map.

A good interactive web map should be responsive to different users and settings. Responsive design is defined as a set of strategies for using the Open Web Platform that dynamically change the content, layout, and styling of a webpage based on the display device and user context. Inspecting the web's codes, the examined project is a responsive web map design particularly because it uses the following:
- 1. **`meta tags`**
- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"><br><img src="img/app2.png" align='center' width='500'><br>. The meta tag tells the browser what width it should render the viewport at (*adaptive cartography*)
- <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"><br><img src="img/app5.png" align='center' width='500'><br>. With this tag, the web map designs will change/adapt based on different use and user contexts, and the computing system could be held in hand, such as a smartphone or tablet (*mobile device*)
- 2. **`div tags`**:
- <div class="page-container"><br><img src="img/app3.png" align='center' width='500'><br> The div tag interlocks set of horizontal rows and vertical columns in a webpage responsively with size based on relative percentage (*fluid grid*)
- <div class="container full-screen main"><br><img src="img/app4.png" align='center' width='500'><br>  The div tag adds a full width containers (which spans 100% of window) inside a container which has a fixed width and aligned center.

### :books: Data Sources
#### A. Data Types
As can be seen from the images/screenshots below, it is clear that the web developers use vector and raster datatypes. The colorful polygons of maps indicate the land parcels/lots with different types of land leases. For instance, the map below shows three types of land leases throughout the U.S. states: federal oil and gas leases (yellow), those leased with minimum bid (blue), and leased noncompetitively (red) <br>. <img src="img/vector1.png" align='center' width='500'><br>The raster type data through tilelayer shows the different contours of lands throughout the U.S. states. The tilelayers were retrieved from ESRI.<br><img src="img/raster.png" align='center' width='500'><br>

| Data type  |Format      | Descriptions |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| *geojson*  | vector | polygons of land lots/parcels to show 3 types of land leases |
| *tilelayer* | raster | land contours in the U.S. states|

#### B. Critiques on the UI/UX
UI (User Interface) Design and UX (User Experience) are two crucial components of the web map which work closely together. Despite their similar roles, each component has different design and process. The User Experience (UX) considers **`each and every element`** that shapes the experience such as how it affects the users' feelings and the easiness of users to access the web map for their own goals. The
UI design on the other hand, focuses on the appearance, presentation, and interactivity of the web map with user. <br>
In general, the web map has successfully proves that a 'simplicity' combined with a thoughtful selections on interactions types could work effectively to convey a comprehensive data from a research. In details, this could be explained as follows:
- user gets a good impression on the problem will be discussed through an background picture of an oil company along with simple three buttons at the top-right corner and think arrow which tells user to scroll down to continue read.<br><img src="img/in1.png" align='center' width='500'><br>
- users can expand the thematic map by clicking the icon at the top-right and clicking the legend at the left-bottom. This makes users easily read, observe, and interact with the map. Clicking the expland icon again will bring the user back to former page with brief narrative.<br><img src="img/in2.png" align='center' width='500'><br>
- users are automatically interacted with zoomed in map as they scroll down the National Dinosaur Monument page<br><img src="img/in3.png" align='center' width='500'><br>
- users could zoom in and zoom out the map as they wish<br><img src="img/in4.png" align='center' width='500'><br>
- users can choose each item of the list to view each content of the story map in systematic way
<br><img src="img/in5.png" align='center' width='500'><br>

### :page_with_curl: Descriptions of Web Map Elements
The web map developers used basemap from Esri. This can be seen from the screenshot below where the scrip tag refers to esri layer. <br><img src="img/tiles.png" align='center' width='500'><br> <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="https://js.arcgis.com/4.15/esri/layers/TileLayer.js"></script>. <br> The thematic or tiled layers however, include
Describe the basemap, the thematic layer and the interactive features if it has.
- list any web map element in use (e.g, scalar bar, north arrow, legend, etc.) if it has. <br>

### :bulb: Strengths & Weaknesses
#### strengths
The strengths of the web map include:
- it relies on responsive design which allows greater access and distribution of the Open Web Platform with cheap development. Since the web map has competencies in languages, inherent cross-platform and non-mobile support, the web map becomes a reliable resources for information to different types of groups or audience.
#### Weaknesses
Since the web map uses a responsive design with target to unlimited audience, the data dsiplayed in the web map reltively experiences a very slow processing and interaction speeds. This consequently requires a strong network connection by the users (Roth et al. 2018)<br>
