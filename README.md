## Digital Geography for Natural Heritage Conservation Mobilization in the U.S.<br>

### :newspaper: Introduction
#### Digital Geography<br>
Digital technology has long enabled scholars to explain phenomena related to almost all aspects of urban living: politics, social, culture, economy, and nature. The relationship between the digital technology and geography takes at least 3 forms:
- **produced through**, meaning that the digital technology is aimed at actualizing unorthodox understanding to produce geographic, politics, and spatial knowledges. Despite criticsm against its use, the engagement between the digital technology and geography has proven to be able to mobilize people power for social change;
- **produced by**, meaning that digital system served cities planning, management, governance, and research by integrating the urban big data, computational modelling, urban simulation, and interactions with diffent users and urban spaces;
- **geographies of digital**, meaning that the digital geographies are sets of technologies that go beyond an engagement with an interface, but with spatial big data. One of the examples is the  geotagged data retrieved from Twitter that can be used to explain sociospatial dynamics in particular area to public (James, Kitchin and Leszczynski 2018, 26-34). <br>

With this understanding, the storymap entitled **`America's Public Land Giveaway`** written by *Andre Miller* is selected for this essay. The storymap provides a good example of how the author carefully designed and selected the web features to provide deeper understanding on the implications of government's un-updated/unreformed land regulation on the natural heritage in the Western part of the U.S. and to mobilize supports from the U.S. wide community for land conservation. <br>
#### Case Study<br>
The goal of the storymap is *to discuss the implications of the federal government and Trump administration's policy of leasing millions of acres of public lands for private oil and gas development with low and outdated rent price on conservation sites of natural heritage in the Western part of the U.S*. These natural heritage include Dinosaur National Monument and critical habitats of plant and animal species situated in 10 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming. The issue revolves around the un-updated leasing system for oil and gas industries' operations in the West. The leasing system had not been renewed since a century ago. However, the leasing has already locked up millions of acres of public land in the West. The disadvantages resulted from this are the ineffective use of the land since limited amount of oil and gas produced from the current oil and gas industries, the decrease in annual tax return at only $ 1.50 per acre for taxpayers, and risks on the natural heritage conservation. <br>
**The major functions of the storymap** is to mobilize public supports for encouraging the congress to modernize the oil and gas leasing system. Through this, the land could be utilized for social, cultural, and environmental purposes which include public recreation and natural heritage conservation. <br> For this reason, the story map does not limit its audience to particular group, rather to the public audience. It is expected that the story could develop public awareness on the issue and mobilize them to encourage congress and the U.S. government to revise the land leasing system and land utilization in the West.<br>. The storymap is the evidence of the power of digital geography which enables people to closely recognize the urban issue and observe how the unseen **`panopticon`** <href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham"> along with its machine exercised power in the U.S.(Foucault 2014, 660).

The authors of the storymap are a non-profit organization for wildlife conservation, **`ï»¿The Wilderness Society`** <https://www.wilderness.org/about-us> and a nonpartisan conservation and advocacy organization for the American West, **`Center for Western Priorities`** <https://westernpriorities.org/about/>.<br>

### :bar_chart: Systematic Architecture
In order to create, serve, and use web mapping, several different machines might be required. THe machines are often depicted in a form of digram consisting of separate levels, or tiers of architecture. The figure below shows a computer with **Web Client Application** label which extends into a little cloud with **External Internet** label. The line from this cloud continues to **Internal Network** label which then leads to the drawing of a **web-server** and **Geospatial server** located below it. The line branches to **File Server** and **Database server**. In the left, there is another computer drawing labeled as **Administrators** and **Internal Client Application**.

<img src="img/system_arc.png" align='center' width='900'> <br>

For the case of the examined project, the systematic architecture could be explained as follows:
- **desktop workstations** are used by the web's administrators and internal client applications to prepare data, author maps, including administer the other machines.
- **database server** and **file server** act as what hold the GIS data and research data of the two organizations. The data might consist of spatial data in raster or vector formats.
- **geospatial server** used to host the web services in this project is that provided by ArcGIS <https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/geoportal-server/overview>. Esri Geoportal Server is known as an open source product that since 1969, has enabled many organizations like the two nonprofit conservation organizations to manage and publish their geospatial data and resources for wide range of users.

The image above shows that the storymap is powered by the use of ArcGIS provided by ESRI geroportal server.

### :lock_with_ink_pen: Code Analysis
In order to investigate the codes employed by the web map, we inspected the web by right-clicking the web browser. As seen from the image below, we found the elements and codes of the web, the data flowed between the client and server, the major libraries with their functions, and whether the web supports responsive design. <br>
<img src="img/inspection.png" align='center' width='900'> <br>

#### Data Flows Between Client and server

| **Library**      | **Functions** |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| airports.geojson   | AIRPRTX010    |


Inspect the code of this project, especially look into the following issues.
  - What are the data flowed in between the client and server.
  - The major libaries in use and their functions.
  - Does this project support responsive design?<br>

### :books: Data Sources
- vectors (i.e., geojson)
- rasters (i.e., tilelayer)
- critique its overalll UI/UX and Web Mapping design if it has.
Below is the table that shows the data library of two geometric/spatial files used in this leaflet: **`airports.geojson`** and **`us-states.geojson`**.

| **data file**      | **attribute** | **type of data** | **source** |
| ------------------ | ------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| airports.geojson   | AIRPRTX010    | Numeric    | airport tax |
| | ICAO | String | four-letter alphanumeric code designating each airport around the world, determined by International Civil Avian Organization.|
